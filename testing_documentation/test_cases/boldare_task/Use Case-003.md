|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Actors                                       | User, Application                                      |
| Description                                  | The user wants to have a live chat functionality implemented into the application, since as of the moment it is only possible to get in touch with the application's creators via e-mail. By implementing this functionality, the users' confidence in the application would increase, as they would be able to communicate with the application's developers in real-time and ask them for assistance, in case something goes wrong while using the application. |
| Steps                                        | 1. User launches the application and navigates to the train ticket booking section.<br>2. User enters the departure station name in the designated input field.<br>3. As the user types in first three characters, the application dynamically suggests matching station names using an autocomplete feature.<br>4. User selects the desired departure station from a drop-down list.<br>5. User repeats the same process for entering the arrival station.<br>6. User enters the desired date of travel.<br>7. User selects the search or submit button to initiate the connection search. |
| Expected Result                              | With the autocomplete feature in place, the user will experience improved efficiency and accuracy in selecting departure and arrival stations. The suggested station names will help users quickly find and select the correct station, reducing the likelihood of errors and minimizing the need for manual typing. This enhancement will lead to a smoother and more user-friendly experience overall, allowing users to search for train connections effortlessly and efficiently. |
