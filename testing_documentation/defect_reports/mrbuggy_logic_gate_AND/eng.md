| Title      | MrBuggy - A defect in the logic gate AND task |
| -----------     | ----------- |
| Environment     | Android 13 Tiramisu |
| Priority        | Medium |
| Steps           |        |
| 1.              | Open the "MrBuggy" application installed on your phone. |
| 2.              | Click on the icon located in the upper right corner of the application. Then, click on the circle with a number '1' in it. |
| 3.              | A logic gate AND task will open. There will be two 'drop-down' type fields/lists, numbers '0' and '1' to choose in both of them. |
| 4.              | Click on both of those fields and enter two indentical numbers into them (which are greater than 2), e.g. '9' and '9'. |
| 5.              | Click on the 'Calculate' button. |
| Actual result   | The result of the logic gate AND is '2'. |
| Expected result | It should not be possible to enter anything into 'drop-down' type fields, let alone values which are different than '0' or '1' (it contradicts the idea behind the logic gate AND). |
